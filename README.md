# pino-hny

> ðŸŒ² Load [pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) logs into Honeycomb

Actually it will convert any data from `stdin` (not just `pino` logs) and if it can parse it
as `JSON` then it will insert that into `honeycomb` otherwise it will insert that as it is, but with `msg` field and a timestamp.

Based upon [pino-couch](https://github.com/IBM/pino-couch)
